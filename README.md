# ACE-DNV: Automatic Classification of Gaze Events in Dynamic Natural Viewing

## Introduction
we introduce a natural viewing eye-movement event classification method that takes head and body motion into account only relying on the scene camera and gaze signal which are provided by a mobile eye-trackers.

![architecture](./figs/arch.png)

The natural eye-movement event detection (NEED) method computes the motion in gaze and head in conjunction with similarity of content in the central visual field and feeds them as input to a classification algorithm to detect gaze fixation, gaze following, gaze pursuit, and gaze shift.

## Execution
The code is tested on UBUNTU 18.06. 
For running the code you need:

1. PyTorch
2. OpenCV
3. Python Libraries: numpy, matplotlib, scipy 
4. 2ch2stream Network (included in repo)
5. (OPTIONAL) MATLAB for some data inspection scripts

To execute the code, edit the `config.py` file and select your dataset and input directory and the rest of params. The exectute 'main.py'.
